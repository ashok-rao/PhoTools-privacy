Overview
PhoTools is an AI-powered Android application. This policy explains how data is collected,
processed, and protected.

Information We Collect
User-provided content such as text prompts and images may be submitted to use AI features. We
also collect limited non-personal data such as device type, OS version, and crash logs.

Image Processing
Images are processed temporarily to generate AI results. Images are transmitted securely to our
backend and forwarded to AI services strictly for processing. Images are not used for advertising,
profiling, or training AI models.

AI & OpenAI API Usage
AI features are powered by OpenAI’s API. Requests are routed through our backend. OpenAI does
not use API data for training. Data may be retained for up to 30 days for abuse prevention and
reliability.

Data Retention
We do not permanently store user prompts or images unless required for app functionality.
Temporary logs may be retained for debugging and security purposes.

Billing, Refunds, and Restore Purchases
The app offers optional premium features via a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase handled
entirely by Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store payment information. Refunds are
governed by Google Play’s refund policy. Purchased features can be restored on supported
devices using the same Google account.

Data Sharing
We do not sell or rent user data. Data is shared only with essential service providers or when
required by law.

Children’s Privacy
This app is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
data from children.

Security
We use encrypted communication and reasonable safeguards to protect data. No system can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure.
