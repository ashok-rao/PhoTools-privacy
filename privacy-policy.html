  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>PhoTools</strong> handles user data.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    PhoTools is an AI-powered Android application. This policy explains how data is collected,
    processed, and protected.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    User-provided content such as text prompts and images may be submitted to use AI features.
    We also collect limited non-personal data such as device type, operating system version,
    and crash logs.
  </p>

  <h2>Image Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Images are processed temporarily to generate AI results. Images are transmitted securely
    to our backend and forwarded to AI services strictly for processing purposes. Images are
    not used for advertising, profiling, or training AI models.
  </p>

  <h2>AI &amp; OpenAI API Usage</h2>
  <p>
    AI features are powered by OpenAI’s API. Requests are routed through our backend.
    OpenAI does not use API data for training. Data may be retained for up to 30 days
    for abuse prevention and reliability.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not permanently store user prompts or images unless required for app functionality.
    Temporary logs may be retained for debugging, monitoring, and security purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Billing, Refunds, and Restore Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    The app offers optional premium features via a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase
    handled entirely by Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store payment information.
    Refunds are governed by Google Play’s refund policy. Purchased features can be restored
    on supported devices using the same Google account.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent user data. Data is shared only with essential service providers
    or when required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
    personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use encrypted communication and reasonable safeguards to protect user data.
    However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
